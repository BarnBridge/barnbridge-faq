      "value": "Yield Farming is the first mechanism delivering initial $BOND token distribution to the community. This contract will hold 8% of the total supply and will be distributed to community members who stake DAI, USDC, & sUSD. This is only phase one of Liquidity Mining.\nPhase two is the Liquidity Mining Incentivization Program. This initiative will be granted 20% of the total supply (2,000,000 $BOND tokens) and each epoch will have 20,000 $BOND tokens to start. This will last 100 weeks."
