      "value": "The concept behind the Liquidity Pool Incentivization initiative is to reward long-term liquidity providers with progressively more power over the protocol as they continue to signal their belief in the BarnBridge vision. Participants who believe in the vision represent the community, we hope, will gain significant control over the protocol’s long-term evolution, and are therefore the users who should be rewarded with the most plentiful harvest."
