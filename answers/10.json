      "value": "BarnBridge Non-Fungible Tokens, also taking the ticker for $BOND, may be and will likely be completely pointless outside of being cool and fun. Every $BOND NFT is one of a kind. There may be similar ones in the collection but no 2 are exactly the same. Downstream, we’ve seen DeFi projects propose using NFTs as proof of liquidity in income streams & wrapped NFTs as loan representations. With almost every high profile DeFi project experimenting in one way or another, the point is clear: DeFi is looking into NFTs. While we’ve been looking at what NFTs mean for DeFi, at the moment, we’re just paying attention."
